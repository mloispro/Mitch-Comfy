# Mitch Comfy Workbench

This repository is the source of truth for Mitch's ComfyUI workflows and locally maintained custom nodes.

## How ComfyUI sees these files

The repository is connected to ComfyUI with Windows directory junctions:

- `workflows` → `C:\projects\AI-Tools\ComfyUI\user\default\workflows\Mitch`
- `custom_nodes\ComfyUI-AIToolkit-Training` → the corresponding ComfyUI custom-node folder
- `custom_nodes\ComfyUI-AlwaysRunImage` → the corresponding ComfyUI custom-node folder

There is no deployment copy. ComfyUI and Git use the same files.

## Everyday workflow

1. Open a workflow under `Mitch/production` or `Mitch/experiments` in ComfyUI.
2. Edit and save normally in ComfyUI. The Git working tree changes immediately.
3. Validate the result.
4. Run `scripts\checkpoint.ps1 -Message "Describe the working change"` to verify and commit it.
5. Use an optional tag for important milestones, for example `-Tag "multiperson-sharp-v2"`.

Production filenames stay stable. Git history replaces duplicate files named `v2`, `final`, or `final-final`.

## What is intentionally not tracked

- Models, LoRAs, and Python environments
- Generated datasets and outputs
- Personal input/reference photographs
- Logs, caches, and compiled Python files
- Machine-local settings such as the live AI-Toolkit `settings.json`

Tracked manifests record important external revisions and hashes without copying large files into Git.
